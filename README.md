## Components

* worker: AVR firmware for worker PCB
* feeder: AVR firmware for rail feeder
* overmind: controls everything, via TWELITE monostick. Written in electron (desktop webapp platform).

## Overmind

First-time only, when you cloned repo, run:
```
cd ./overmind
npm install
```

To develop / run overmind, you need two consoles.

In one, do the following to compile & setup dynamic reloader for
```
cd ./overmind
npm run dev
```

Then, in another, to start the app:
```
cd ./overmind
npm start
```

## Requirements

Re-creating

* SLA 3d printing: Form2
* PWB manufacturer: Seeed studio
* Electronic parts: All are sourceabe from digikey
* PCB reflow oven
* USBasp

## AVR Firmware writing

First time only:
```
scons writefuse
```

First time & whenever code is changed:
```
scons write-builder
```
or
```
scons write-feeder
```

Just compile and see resulting FW size:
```
scons
```

# Communication Protocol Stack

## Commands

* p: print status
* e: enqueue actions

```
Command
  = "p"
  | "e" Action+
```

```
Action = [Duration ms : 2] ([ActionTarget ASCII: 1] [ActionVal int : 1]*)*
```

e.g.
```
eA123BCD-23
```

## Addressing

Everything is in big endian.

overmind -> worker
```
Packet = [dest addr : 4] Command
```
When addr = 0xffffffff, it means broadcasting.

worker -> overmind
```
Packet = [src addr : 4] [worker timestamp in millisec : 4] [JSON ascii : N]
```
