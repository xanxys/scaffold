/**
 * Sequence of Actions that needs to be atomically sent (i.e. with single command) to workers.
 * 
 * This is necessary for two reasons:
 * 1. Preventing worker breakage. Very common pattern is [start, stop].
 * 2. Providing fake physics.
 * 
 * Some of the movement (e.g. goto origin) is difficult to model with proper physics yet.
 * In the mean while, ActionSeq provides fake physics specific to the actionSeq.
 * 
 * Reason 2 should be gone eventually, as we make sensor data collectible and incorporate
 * ML-based physics simulation.
